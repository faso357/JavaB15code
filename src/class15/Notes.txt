Methods in Java:
    Is just a collection of java statements and blocks of code like if else loop printlns etc.
Why should we learn about methods:
    1) it Allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the logic into smaller parts by creating methods
    for them build those methods one by one and later on combine them to build the complete application.
    2) Methods allow us to re-use code.
    3) Methods allow us to be flexible.
How can we create Methods?
    There are two types built-in and user defined.
Built-in methods?
    The methods which are designed by Java developers for example the printLn() nextInt() method in the scanner
    class length() present in String class they are all built-in methods.
User Defined Methods:
    They methods that we write.
Methods which return something when called and others are methods which do not return anything when called.

 int add(int a,int b){
 return a+b;
 }
 int => return type of a method
 add => name of the method
 (int a,int b) => parameters of the method or the input to the method
 {  => body of the method
 }
Rules:
return type and the values that we are returning from a method should match
we can only assign methods to variables of same type.
