MethodOverloading:
    It's a mechanism in java that allows us to have same method name with different parameters.
    Parameters can be different in number,type or sequence.
Why we should overload a method?
    1)Method overloading allows us to reuse same method name again and again that we don't have to
    come up with different method names if we are doing the same thing again and again.
    2) it allows us to write clean code.
How to overload a method:
    We can overload a method by redefining it with different parameters.
Method Overriding:
     It's a mechanism in java that allows a subclass or child class to provide a
     specific implementation of a method.
Why we should override a method?
    If a child class does not like the implementation of the parent class it has
    the flexibility that iut can override that method.

Syntax of override?
    There must be a parent child relationship between two classes.
